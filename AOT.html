            <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I've had an infatuation with Attack on Titan since 2014 when I first watched the show as a child. The anime possesses a rich symbolic cornucopia
                that profoundly resonated with my unfounded symbolic intuition. Before I even discovered the remarkable philisophical and psychological framework of Jung,
                I was performing a rudimentary Jungian analysis of the show. The story struck a chord that I couldn't quite make out, and I'm still not sure if I've
                entirely consolidated the philosophy. However, this is my best attempt to do just that. To begin, I will chronologically progress whilst giving my best
                conjecture of the representations of the outstanding symbolic archetypes. One final note before we begin: I strongly suspect, with reason, that Isayama's
                work derives it's cardinal value through the chronological organization of the presentation of his story; the chronological structure consolidates the story
                with the allusion to potentially profound implications, some of which I wish to explore (including Nietzsche's Eternal Reoccurence).
            </p>

            <h2>Eren as the Embodied Shadow</h2>
            <p>
                Eren Yeager’s journey is a descent into the unconscious. As he becomes more like the enemy, he mirrors Nietzsche’s warning:
                "He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster." Eren, in many ways, is the literalization of the shadow's possession.
            </p>

            <h2>Archetypes in Conflict</h2>
            <p>
                Characters such as Armin (the wise old man), Mikasa (the anima protector), and Levi (the stoic hero) each serve as archetypal figures
                guiding or opposing the ego in its quest. These roles evolve and intertwine, suggesting that no archetype is static—each must integrate.
            </p>

            <h2>The Path of Individuation</h2>
            <p>
                The finale of Attack on Titan leaves us with no easy answers. It mirrors the individuation process—not a journey toward perfection,
                but toward wholeness. Destruction and integration go hand in hand. The Titans must not only be defeated but understood.
            </p>

            <p><em>"Who is the real enemy?"</em> is not just a plot question—it is a psychological one. The real enemy is the part of ourselves we do not wish to face.</p>
