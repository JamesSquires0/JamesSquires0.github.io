            <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I've had an infatuation with Attack on Titan since 2014 when I first watched the show as a child. The anime possesses a rich symbolic cornucopia
                that profoundly resonated with my unfounded symbolic intuition. Before I even discovered the remarkable philisophical and psychological framework of Jung,
                I was performing a rudimentary Jungian analysis of the show. The story struck a chord that I couldn't quite make out, and I'm still not sure if I've
                entirely consolidated the philosophy. However, this is my best attempt to do just that. To begin, I will chronologically progress whilst giving my best
                conjecture of the representations of the outstanding symbolic archetypes. One final note before we begin: I strongly suspect, with reason, that Isayama's
                work derives it's cardinal value through the chronological organization of the presentation of his story; the chronological structure consolidates the story
                with the allusion to potentially profound implications, some of which I wish to explore (including Nietzsche's Eternal Reoccurence).
