                Attack on Titan, beyond its post-apocalyptic warfare and stunning animation, is a rich psychological allegory.
                Through the lens of Carl Jung, the series becomes a stage where archetypes battle and shadows are confronted in an epic journey of individuation.
            </p>

            <h2>The Shadow and the Wall</h2>
            <p>
                The Titans, monstrous and grotesque, symbolize the repressed unconscious—Jung’s "shadow." These beings
                are not simply enemies but psychological projections of humanity’s darkest instincts. The very wall meant to keep them out is a metaphor for repression.
            </p>

            <h2>Eren as the Embodied Shadow</h2>
            <p>
                Eren Yeager’s journey is a descent into the unconscious. As he becomes more like the enemy, he mirrors Nietzsche’s warning:
                "He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster." Eren, in many ways, is the literalization of the shadow's possession.
            </p>

            <h2>Archetypes in Conflict</h2>
            <p>
                Characters such as Armin (the wise old man), Mikasa (the anima protector), and Levi (the stoic hero) each serve as archetypal figures
                guiding or opposing the ego in its quest. These roles evolve and intertwine, suggesting that no archetype is static—each must integrate.
            </p>

            <h2>The Path of Individuation</h2>
            <p>
                The finale of Attack on Titan leaves us with no easy answers. It mirrors the individuation process—not a journey toward perfection,
                but toward wholeness. Destruction and integration go hand in hand. The Titans must not only be defeated but understood.
            </p>

            <p><em>"Who is the real enemy?"</em> is not just a plot question—it is a psychological one. The real enemy is the part of ourselves we do not wish to face.</p>
